# Overview

"Dust to Ash" is a simple, turn-based combat game that puts the player against a wave of 2-3 enemies at a time. Every three waves, a single Boss Monster will spawn, which must be defeated in order to progress to the next level. Every Boss Monster drops an item, which can be kept in-between runs, even if the player dies. That said, all other progress **will be lost**, should the player fall at any point during their run. As the player progresses through their run, the enemies will progressively grow more difficult.

## Planned Features

- **Character Selection**: select from three characters, each with their own attacks, resistances, and weaknesses
- **Enemy Generation**: enemies will automatically be selected based on the fighting character
- **Persistent Item Storage**: items dropped by *Bosses* are retained through all runs
- **Progressive Combat**: enemies become stronger with every defeated wave
